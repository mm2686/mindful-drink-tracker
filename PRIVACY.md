# Privacy Policy for Mindful Drink Tracker

**Last Updated: February 2026**

Your privacy is our priority. The Mindful Drink Tracker app is designed with a "privacy-first" approach:

1. **No Data Collection:** We do not collect, store, or share any of your personal drinking data.
2. **Local Storage:** All drink logs and reminders are stored strictly on your own device.
3. **No Third-Party Tracking:** There are no hidden trackers, ads, or third-party analytics.
4. **Permissions:** The app only requests permissions necessary for local notifications (reminders).

This app is provided as a tool for personal mindfulness.
